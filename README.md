# Arbitrary Precision Integer Calculator

>[Becky-Nayere](https://github.com/beckynayere)


# Description  

The Arbitrary Precision Integer Calculator is a Python-based calculator that supports high-precision arithmetic and advanced operations. Designed without relying on external libraries for core functionality, it provides an interactive REPL interface for users to perform calculations.
 ## Features

#Basic Arithmetic Operations:

*Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Modulo (%), and Exponentiation (^).

*Factorials:

Computes the factorial of non-negative integers (!).

*Logarithms:

Calculates the integer part of base-10 logarithms (log10).

*Base Conversions:

Converts numbers between decimal (base 10) and other bases (e.g., binary, hexadecimal).

*Interactive REPL Interface:

Allows users to input expressions and receive results in real-time.
